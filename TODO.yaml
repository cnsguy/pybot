modules:
  - repeat module
  - choice module
  - date module (play back message at specific date)

core:
  - lisp-like command parsing
  - refactor BotInstance into inheriting a basic IrcClient
  - channel joining / saving should be BotInstance core stuff
  - ssl:
    - currently trying to connect to a server with an invalid certificate will just result in a "socket closed" error and no more info
    - it should really be possible to trust some certificates manually instead of the current method of accepting anything and making SSL completely useless
