modules:
  - date module (play back message at specific date)
  - maybe some kind of json -> python object mapping thing

core:
  - lisp-like command parsing
  - refactor BotInstance into inheriting a basic IrcClient
  - channel / config saving
  - ssl:
    - currently trying to connect to a server with an invalid certificate will just result in a "socket closed" error and no more info
    - it should really be possible to trust some certificates manually instead of the current method of accepting anything and making SSL completely useless
  - bot-events:
    - handle exceptions gracefully and report in the same fashion as irc events currently work

bugs:
  - nick tracking is somehow bad - halfop sigil?
